## Some regarding the behavior of my extensions ##

group add - will add current members of one group to another. Any member that are already
    members of both groups will remain members of both groups. Groups always have unique
    members.

group remove - will remove all current members of one group from another. Any members that
   are already not in the primary group will remain not members, using group remove just
   ensures that the two groups share no members.
