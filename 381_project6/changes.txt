# Tracking updates made from Project 5 to Project 6

- In Moving_object:
    added ability to jump to location

- In Agent class:
    added ability to vary starting health
    added container of pointers to Groups the Agent is a member of
    added public interface functions to add/remove Group pointers
    added public interface function to ask if two Agents share a Group
    added protected interface function to jump Agent to any location (think teleport)

- Changed default values of concrete Agents attributes

- In Geometry module:
    added function to allow get value of pi
    added function to do comparison of Points with tolerance
    added function to do comparison of doubles with tolerance
    added member function to normalise Cartesian_vectors
    added struct Rotation2D to represent rotation matrices
    added operator* overload to perform rotations on Points and
      Cartesian_vectors using matrix multiplication

- In Model module:
    Model no longer throws Errors if searches for Agents or 
      Structure are not found. Instead the Model will return empty pointers
      and it is the callers responsibility to check the returned pointers.

- In Controller module:
    Controller now throws Errors for missing Agents, Structure, or Groups the
      user may be attempting to command.
