/*
Model is part of a simplified Model-View-Controller pattern.
Model keeps track of the Sim_objects in our little world. It is the only
component that knows how many Structures and Agents there are, but it does not
know about any of their derived classes, nor which Agents are of what kind of Agent. 
It has facilities for looking up objects by name, and removing Agents.  When
created, it creates an initial group of Structures and Agents using the Structure_factory
and Agent_factory.
Finally, it keeps the system's time.

Controller tells Model what to do; Model in turn tells the objects what do, and
when asked to do so by an object, tells all the Views whenever anything changes that might be relevant.
Model also provides facilities for looking up objects given their name.

Notice how only the Standard Library headers need to be included - reduced coupling!
