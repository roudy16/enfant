I declare some variables const if I plan on not editing their data, however
I need to cast off the const to get the compiler to quiet. Is this okay? 
   -Look at Room.c load_Room for example

Checking for NULL pointers or assert that they are not NULL?

I have void* that are not supposed to be void*, can I forward declare structs 
so I can write the correct types?
