NOTES TO SELF FOR PROJECT 5:

- use try blocks when doing stuff than can throw an exception, missed this in P4.
- Ensure functions are defined in order.
- See course materials on EOF
- Don't add flexibility that isn't needed...how to know if it's needed?
- Review comments and ensure they are still relevant.
